# Random-Account-Generator
Generates random accounts with a name, email, password, and phone number and emails a csv file of the accounts to any preferred client.
Run window.py to see the popup window I made using PyQt5.
Also, the ability to randomize the names is optional, and if you choose not to, you can input your desired name.
In order to have the email portion work, you must create a gmail account that has "Less Secure App Access" turned on.
